# Burn Image Models

## Overview

This (as yet unreleased) package aims to provide a small part of the python `timm` package,
for the Rust Burn ecosystem.

It is a collection of image models, and their support machinery.

Currently, it is a work in progress to build an initial version of SWIN-Transformer V2.
